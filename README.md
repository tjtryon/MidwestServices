## Organizational Summary
Midwest Event Services, Inc., a central Indiana based not-for-profit, is an evebt host having hosted over 400 road running, not limited to: cross country, triathlon, cycling,
duathlob, track and field events and Hokum Karem Cross Country Relays. Additionally, we allow other central-Indiana not-for-profits to utilize our services as a vehicle to
use for fundraising, ie. either the runners pay $100 with $75 going to the charity, runners can set fundraising goals and raise money for the race, which goes directly to the
charity.

Even though Midwest Event Services, Inc, is itself a Indiana Domestic Not-For-Profit, and we typically work with other not-for-profits, there are typically fees assocuated wuth
the extent you have us involved with the planning. We can have everything from showing up on race day, setting up an arch and time races, or make charity walks memoriable, all the
way to being a turn-key, hands-off approach for you, where youo show up on race day, and get to interact with your client base, and have no real rasks aside from a small sopeach
about the purpose of the run.  Typically, Midwest Events and our clients meet somewhere in the middle, helping with whatever is needed, based on time and the amount of work necessary.

As Midwest Event Services is a not-for-profit, and as race margins are thin for most racing companies, our margins are extra thin, so we can maximize whatevr we can do to help the
host charity with their findraiser.

## Current Projects:
- Planning for a small 2026 5k race comeback.
- Possibility of future cycling TT races.
  
- The Race Timing Solution (RTS). Started 2025/02/24 as of 2025/08/17, below reports on the status:
    - Race timing software for cross country and road races.
    - Contains 2 formats:
        - Modular Connectivity and Standards - The console and gui application back-ends, as well as the web-based front-emd programs are connected and integrated 
          as modules, ensuring both versions of the race timing use the same race logic, the same databases, aand same informaton.
        - From an end-user (athlete, coach, parent), there will be no differenct in the experience, irrespective of the backend software used. It will be a clean
          visual, responsive Flask website application, with routes for the end users to find the individual and team scores, a help file with a FAQ, a contact_us
          rorm and a page that they can find more about the timing company. For the timing company users, they will be able to log into the admin pages. These contain
          the ability to edit results, view documentation, print individual and team results.
        - This siftware has been written in Python, so it will run on any hardware that has a Python port, and access to a unix shell. You can easily run the console
          application on a phone, gui application on an Android or Chrome tablet or netbook.. It also works with Linix and Unix systens, I do not currently have access
          to a MAC platform, so I am not sure about IOS or any of their notebook offerings.
        - To Do:
            - Get Mac book to test on.
            - Get Ipad to test on.
            - Get amtennas and Ipico UHF readers out of trailer.
            - get logic board for Ipico Lite.
            - Get cables for ThingMagic reader. 
            - Test the incoming (7/18) Impinj and Motorola readers.   
        - Both formats will undergo extensive testing in Q3 2025, for a Q4 2025 release.
        - Will be working on the RFID mode for both packages, to make compatable with am Impenj reader, a Motorola reader, and Ipico Lite and Ipico UHF systems.
        - We are willing to integrate our software with any commercial riming system manufacturer's hardware, as well as other, more open setups, not limited to readers 
          or operating systems. We would love to get a BlueBox to test with the software, and would love to get both a Mac Laptop and iPad to test the software.
        - The console version is fully usable, but it is marked as 0.8 beta, as there will me many changes.
  ## üöß Future Work
    - üñ•Ô∏è GTK GUI for desktop use.
    - üåê Enhanced Flask features.
    - Robust RFID integration.

In the future, when I work on the CS50 Python class, I will expand this project by building a Python-based GTK GUI. This version will offer greater functionality for race-day management. 
I will also extend the Flask app to handle post-race tasks such as editing results and providing lookup tools for participants. This work is not part of my CS50x final project but demonstrates 
how I applied and extended my learning beyond the course.
